# Machine learning algorithms
Here is the folder where all the different machine learning algorithms were tested. Each algorithm was tested
in its own file. In the folder **old models** previous models and datasets of each machine learning algorithm can be found. 
The folder ** Datasets **contains the datasets used for the models which were obtained from SMHI. The hyperparamters used in the models
were obtained using gridsearch CV.

## Data pre-processing
All data preprocessing is done in the *readFiles2* file. That is where all the different datasets are merged into one 
single dataset. ![Minion](https://github.com/findlay-forsblom/2DT00E-DegreeProject/tree/master/Algorithm/images/features.png)
